## tinystack

I am using this project to build a tiny stack and teach programming.
Tinystack will include the following:

 * Golang API
 * Vanilla Javascript frontend (no build)
 * SQLite for a database (deployed with Go)
 * Terraform for GCP VM instance
 * Packer for the image build
 * Ansible for misc tasks and Docker deployment

 This repository may be in iterative disarray as we teach and then refactor.
