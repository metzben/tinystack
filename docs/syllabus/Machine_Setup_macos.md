## Machine Setup (macOS)
This provides a step-by-step process for how you may wish to set up your development machine if you are a Mac user. This is not required and you may already have your machine set up, but there are tips and tricks that will make you more efficient. It's worth a watch either way. 

The process to set up your machine will be similar if you are using a Windows or Linus machine, but the steps may be different. Please raise to the group if you need assistance with those operating systems.
