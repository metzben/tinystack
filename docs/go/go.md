# The GO Programming Language

# Introduction
`Go` (golang) is our server-side language for Tinystack. Created within Google, it was released in 2009 and a team within Google still supports the language. It is [open-source](https://go.googlesource.com/go). We'll be diving into a variety of topics about Go specifically, but also provide guidance on `programming best practices` that will be demonstrated in the language.
