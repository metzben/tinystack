# Tinystack Syllabus

### Introduction

Tinystack will be developed into a production ready application over time. To get there, we will explore topics related to `programming best practices`, `go`, `large language models`, and share a few opinions along the way. This syllabus will attempt to be a map that guides you along the way.

## Future Topics to Cover
- HTTP clients with all the bells and whistles (timeouts, retry strategy, etc)
- Interfaces in Go (& uses in standard library)

## Topics

### Go Programming Language
`Go` (golang) is our server-side language for Tinystack. Created within Google, it was released in 2009 and a team within Google still supports the language. It is [open-source](https://go.googlesource.com/go). We'll be diving into a variety of topics about `go` specifically, but also provide guidance on `programming best practices` that will be demonstrated in the language.

To learn more about Go, [visit here](/docs/go/go.md).

### Large Language Models (LLMs) 
Tinystack will retrieve results from one or more LLMs in the application. For a deeper dive into LLMs, [visit here](/docs/syllabus/Large_Language_Models.md).
